# Development Rewrite Notes
- use yarn instead of npm
- tabs instead of spaces
- mocha > jest
- app folder: backend
	- files in folder are necessary for entire app, such as the keyvault
	- each subfolder is dedicated to different chains, such as veve, sol, eth
	- GENERAL UTILS.TS IS ONLY FOR GENERAL UTILS THAT APPLY TO ALL CHAINS
	- Do not use shorthand name, such as AVAX for avalanche, or ETH for ethereum. Be verbose
	- Can abstract and use general utils (such as keyvault) into specific
- ui folder: frontend, electron, etc
